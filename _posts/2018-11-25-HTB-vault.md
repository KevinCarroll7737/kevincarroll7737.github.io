After a few enumerations, you should have quickly reached this login page. If you didn't, you should consider enumerating recursevily directories.

> Trying to pass this login page was not the solution. After a while I told my self, what if the index page is saying right. So kept enumerating and found new files.

This page gave access to a file upload module with restrictions. Hence, impossible to tell the server to execute commands through a script directly. I remembered few [technics](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unrestricted_File_Upload) for bypassing this type of server side control:

+ Adding a double extension: `myFile.jpg.php`
+ Changing letters to their capital forms: `myFile.PhP`
+ Using short name (for Windows servers)
+ Dropping the string after the first extension by using the `NULL` character `0x00`: `myFile.jpg0x00.php`
+ Finding missed extension (e.g. `.php5`, `.pht`, `.phtml`, `.shtml`, `.asa`, `.cer`, `.asax`, `.swf`, or `.xap`)

> Replacing the reverse shell extension for the missed extension `.php5` gave access to the ubuntu host as `www-data`.

My first reflex was to check what services were reachable from the internal.

Note that local IP adress `192.168.122.1:53` is on another network. 

Since nmap was disabled for the `www-data` user, I try to run `socat` and `ncat` in order to be able to do port forwarding, but they wasn't installed. Then it took a second to find the files left on the desktop, which allowed me to rotate through ssh!

```bash
cat key
itscominghome

cat /home/dave/Desktop/ssh
dave
Dav3therav3123

cat Servers 
DNS + Configurator - 192.168.122.4
Firewall - 192.168.122.5

```
ssh -fNtD 9050 dave@10.10.10.109 [-L 127.0.0.1:8888:192.168.122.4:80]

This [medium article](https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/reverse-shell-from-an-openvpn-configuration-file-73fd8b1d38da) defines well what it is and how it's possible to pop a shell out of an OpenVPN config file, so I wont go in details.

```

> At this point you could have change the root password and connect with ssh using these credentials and found alex's `.bash_history` where you would have seen that he was pinging the `192.168.5.2` IP adress. But no chance, this adress was no longuer reachable. 

All the traffic to the Vault was passing trough the  `192.168.122.5` firewall. 

Bypassing firewall was easy. All I had to do was adding another IP adress to the same interface and remove that routing. Then, running a basic scan on this target to unveil the `987/tcp` port wich was exposing a ssh service that was using the same credential then the DNS box.

Welcome to the Vault!
=====================

To complete the box, you had to `scp` the `root.txt.gpg` back to the ubuntu box and pass the key `itscominghome`. ;)

```
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "david <dave@david.com>"
4096-bit RSA key, ID D1EB1F03, created 2018-07-24 (main key ID 0FDFBFE4)

gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID D1EB1F03, created 2018-07-24
      "david <dave@david.com>"
      gpg: .srb: unknown suffix
      Enter new filename [root.txt]: root.txt

cat root.txt
