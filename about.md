<p>My obsessive-compulsive drive to understand how things work led me to become a cybersecurity consultant. It all began with my university studies in mathematics, which laid the foundation for my deep understanding of IT networks, full-stack programming, wireless mechanisms, and low-level programming languages. I've been fortunate to attend most of the major events in Montreal, including CTF competitions, workshops, and conferences. Now, I want to share my knowledge with others who share my passion for learning.</p>
