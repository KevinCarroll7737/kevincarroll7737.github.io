<p>My obsessive-compulsive disorder of wanting to understand how things work has made me a cybersecurity consultant. It started with mathematics at university and allowed me to understand IT networks, full stack programming, wireless mechanisms and low-level programming language. I am fortunate to be present at most of the events - CTF - Workshops & Conferences - in Montreal and would like to offer to those who like me want to learn my knowledge.</p>
